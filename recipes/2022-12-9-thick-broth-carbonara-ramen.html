        <h1>Thick Broth Carbonara Ramen</h1>
            <img src="https://github.com/MonadAcolyte/odin-recipes/blob/main/images/samyang-karbonara.jpeg" alt="Samyang: carbonara edition">
            <p>This is how you can turn a normal ramen pack into the glorious TBC-ramen.</p>
            <p>I reccomend that you use samyang's carbonara pack, as that will provide the better result.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ramen pack</li>
                <li>An egg</li>
                <li>Leek</li>
                <li>Chillies (if your ramen pack isn't spicy)</li>
                <li>Sausages (Vegan or Carcass)</li>
                <li>Tofu</li>
                <li>Ghee</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a pot with as much water as a bowl can hold and set it to boil.</li>
                <li>Add the broth sackets within the ramen pack, if you're cooking samyang add the powder and the sauce together.</li>
                <li>Cut the tofu in a slice that can cover 60% of the bowls top area and throw in the broth.</li>
                <li>On a pan, fry the leek with some Ghee. Then set it aside.</li>
                <li>On the pan, fry the sausages. Preferably, cut them into octopus shape before frying them. Once thy're done, set them aside.</li>
                <li>Once the tofu has boiled in the broth for a good 5mins, fry is as well and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Lastly boil the noodles in the broth. During the 2mins that they take to cook, scramble the egg.</li>
                <li>Turn off the fire and throw the egg on the noodles, stir vigorously utill the egg fully merges with the broth.</li>
                <li>Now it's time to put everything together. The tofu goes on top, everything else goes on the broth.</li>
            </ol>
