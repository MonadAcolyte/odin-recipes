        <h1>Ancient roman Copadia</h1>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>The copadia is an ancient roman recipe featuring some classic ingredients like garum and defrutum. It is filling and flavorful, but takes a lot of time to make from scratch.</p>
            <p>This variant of the classical Copadia was taken from Historical Italian Cooking: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations">Beef Stew (Copadia)</a></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Garum. Alternatively, use fish sauce or squid sacue</li>
                <li>Defrutum. It's reduced wine juice, strained or unstrained</li>
                <li>A cheap cut of meat, diced into large chunk</li>
                <li>Roasted, peeled almonds</li>
                <li>A red onion</li>
                <li>A cople of dried dates</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Parsley</li>
                <li>Vinegar, preferably red wine vinegar</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Roast the almonds if you haven't done so. Then set them aside, and crush them.</li>
                <li>On the very same mortar add the black pepper and the dates. Crush them. The date can be crushed only lightly.</li>
                <li>Slice the onion as you like and set it to fry on a pot.</li>
                <li>Add the meat a few second after.</li>
                <li>Add the ground items.</li>
                <li>Add the garum, vinegar, and defrutum.</li>
                <li>While it simmers, cut the parsley and set it aside.</li>
                <li>There is no set cooking time. Let it reduce, the more it cooks without burning the better it'll be.</li>
            </ol>
